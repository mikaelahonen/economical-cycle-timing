# Economical Cycle Timing
If you invest monthly to index based ETF, does it matter at which stage of economical cycle you start?

Check out the `economical-cycle-timing.ipynb` for the data analyis.

## Data
The `msci-world-index-historical-data-1969-2018.xlsx` file contains the investment data.

## Development environment
I used Ubuntu subsystem for Windows for development. The env_example.sh contains a template script that you can paste to Ubuntu editor when starting a development session.

Python 3.6 has been used. In Ubuntu 18 python 3.6 should be pre-installed. Try it with command `python3 -V`.

[Install anaconda](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart).

Install virtual environment by `pip3 install virtualenv`. Create a new virtualenv by `virtualenv venv`.
